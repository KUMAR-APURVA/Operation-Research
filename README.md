Queuing theory refers to the mathematical study of the formation, function, and 
congestion of waiting lines, or queues.
At its core, a queuing situation involves two parts :-

    1. Someone or something that requests a service—usually referred to as the customer, job, or request.
    
    2. Someone or something that completes or delivers the services—usually referred to as the server.
    
### Single Server Queuing Model (M/M/1)

In queueing theory, a M/M/1 queuing model represents a system having a 
single server, where arrivals are determined by a Poisson process and job 
service times have an exponential distribution.

### Multiple Server Queuing Model (M/M/c)

In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of 
probability, the M/M/c queue (or Erlang–C model) is a multi-server 
queueing model.
